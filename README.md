# Dynasty Baseball Projections — Web App

A web application for browsing 20-year MLB dynasty baseball projections (2026–2045) and generating personalized dynasty rankings with custom league settings.

## Production

- Live site: https://fantasy-foundry.com
- Hosting: Railway (Docker deploy from this repository)

## Features

- **Projections Explorer** — Browse, search, filter, and sort hitter/pitcher projections across 20 seasons
- **Dynasty Value Calculator** — Configure your league settings (teams, roster, categories, IP caps) and generate Monte Carlo–based dynasty rankings
- **Free & ad-free** — No accounts, no paywalls

## Local Development

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+

### Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the dev server
uvicorn backend.app:app --reload --port 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000

### Running Tests
```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"
```

### Running Browser E2E Tests (Playwright)
```bash
# Install app + dev test dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install Playwright Chromium once
python -m playwright install chromium

# Run the pagination integration test
python -m unittest tests/test_e2e_projections_pagination.py
```

This test launches the app locally, selects `All Years` in the projections view, and verifies:
- the UI reports more than 5,000 hitter rows
- the browser issued paginated API requests including `offset=5000`

### Updating Projections

When you update the Excel file, re-run the preprocessing to regenerate the JSON data files:

```bash
python preprocess.py
```

## Deployment

### Docker
```bash
docker build -t dynasty-projections .
docker run -p 8000:8000 dynasty-projections
```

### Railway / Render / Fly.io
All three support Dockerfiles out of the box:

1. Push this repo to GitHub
2. Connect the repo to your hosting provider
3. It will auto-detect the Dockerfile and deploy

**Railway** (recommended for simplicity):
- Free tier: 500 hours/month, 512 MB RAM — plenty for this app
- Just connect your GitHub repo and deploy
- Current production custom domain: https://fantasy-foundry.com

## API Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/meta` | Filter options (teams, years, positions) |
| GET | `/api/projections/bat` | Hitter projections (query params: player, team, year, years, pos, dynasty_years, include_dynasty, limit, offset) |
| GET | `/api/projections/pitch` | Pitcher projections (same query params) |
| POST | `/api/calculate` | Run dynasty value calculator (JSON body with league settings) |

`years` accepts comma-separated years and inclusive ranges, for example `2026,2028-2030`.
If both `year` and `years` are provided, results use the intersection.
`dynasty_years` accepts comma-separated years and inclusive ranges, for example `2026,2028-2030`.
`pos` accepts one or more exact position tokens (comma, slash, or space separated), for example `SP,RP` or `1B/OF`.

## Next Steps

Some ideas for future development:

- **Player profile pages** — individual player pages with year-by-year projection charts
- **Comparison tool** — side-by-side player comparisons
- **League mode** — add the full custom league settings (SP/RP/P slots, OPS, SVH categories)
- **Export** — download rankings as CSV or Excel
- **Projection freshness indicators** — show when each player's projection was last updated
- **Mobile optimization** — responsive improvements for phone-sized screens
